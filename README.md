# Shor-s-algorithm
Shor's algorithm implemented by quantum (Qiskit by IBM) and classical

'Shor_quantum_detail.ipynb' and 'Shor_quantum.ipynb' show exactly the same behavior. 

'Shor_quantum_detail.ipynb' is a program visualized by only basic gates (H, X, Swap, U1, including controlled) while 'Shor_quantum.ipynb' is a program visualized by integrated gates such as QFTdagger.

Therefore, 'Shor_quantum_detail.ipynb' is usefull for understanding the implimentation of each qubit
On the other hand, 'Shor_quantum.ipynb' is for grasping the consept of Shor's algorithm.



Note!
'Shor_quantum_detail.ipynb' and 'Shor_quantum.ipynb' are able only to calculate prime factorization of 15 (N = 15), and 'a' must be 2,7,8,11 or 13.
